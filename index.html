					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<p class"main"> Growing up on the SouthSide of Chicago opportunities are not handed to you. 
						I grew up knowing that if there is anything that I want I have to go after it and work hard for it.
						My parent's did a great job exposing me to different things, and that's how I figured out what I wanted to do with my life. 
					</p>
					<p>At an early age I looked to creative writing as being my escape. It got me through middle school, high school, and when it was time for me to go to college I decided Fiction Writing would be my major. 
						After a year and a half at Columbia College I lost my love for freely writing fiction, so I dropped out. I began working in hospitality soon after, and worked my way through resturants to eventually the Hotel industry. </p>

					<p>Still not satified with my choice of a career I decided it was time for a change. Besides fiction wiritng, coding was the only other thing I was interested in. 
						I'm very excited to begin my journey toward being a full stack developer and can't wait to see the things that I create. 	
					</p>
					<p> Besides writing and coding, I love to travel. So far I've been to Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Dakar, Senegal.</p>
